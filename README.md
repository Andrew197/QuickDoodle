The default S-Pen application (S-Note) is not particularly fast to start on some devices (such as the Note 2 or Tab 10.1) and its large feature set can be cumbersome if all you need to do is jot something down quickly. I made Quickdoodle specifically to fill this gap.<br><br>
It contains a single surface for note taking, and three controls:<br>
Red (clear the canvas, with a two-click confirmation mechanism)<br>
Green (save the canvas to /sdcard/dcim/quickdoodles)<br>
Blue: (switch from pen(Blue) to eraser (pink))<br>

Quickdoodle is now available at the <b><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrewpinion.qdoodle&hl=en">Google Play Store</a></b> for devices running Android 4.4 Kitkat or later. The kitkat requirement is a Google play related bug that I am currently investigating, the build hosted here on github works on all devices running Android 4.0 or later.
