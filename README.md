The default S-Pen application (S-Note) is not particularly fast to start on some devices (such as the Note 2 or Tab 10.1) and its large feature set can be cumbersome if all you need to do is jot something down quickly. I made Quickdoodle specifically to fill this gap.<br><br>
It contains a single surface for note taking, and three controls:<br>
Red (clear the canvas, with a two-click conformation mechanism)<br>
Green (lock the canvas, no edits can be made accidentally)<br>
Blue: (switch from pen(Blue) to eraser (pink))<br>
To save your canvas, just take screenshots.

Quickdoodle isn't yet on the Play Store, but will be uploaded there soon. To Install, download it on your device from here, and make sure "Unknown Sources" is checked onn in your system settings (usually under applications or security)
